Welcome to Cougar!
==================

Cougar is an open source framework for implementing well defined service interfaces with true transport independence, freeing you up to write your core logic. Originally written by [Betfair](http://www.betfair.com), and powering their core services, it is a high performance framework, easily supporting high concurrency requirements.

It is released under the [Apache Software Licence v2](http://www.apache.org/licenses).

Releases
--------

Cougar is currently in the process of being open-sourced, and so the code is currently unavailable. Once it is, it will be published in the Sonatype OSS Snapshot repo until the first release is pushed to Maven Central.
